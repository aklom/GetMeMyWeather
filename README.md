# Get me my weather! :sunny:




Bored of having to enter your city name on Google to see if you have to take your umberella out or not ? :umbrella: 

<b>Get me my weather</b> automatically detects your browser's location and displays the weather outside, in a fancy and easy to read interface. You can even check the sunrise and sunset times to no longer miss anyone of them! :sunrise:
